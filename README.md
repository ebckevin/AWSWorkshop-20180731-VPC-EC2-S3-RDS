Startup Workshop Series (2018-07-31) VPC-EC2-S3-RDS
======
### Repo: [https://github.com/juntinyeh/AWSWorkshop-20180731-VPC-EC2-S3-RDS]

Today we are going to practice a very simple scenario, create a VPC with different network topology, include public subnet and private subnet. And we will create bastion machine, Application Load Balancer with Web server, a backend machine inside the private subnet, a RDS server and also a S3 bucket.

今天我們將練習一個非常簡單的場景，創建一個具有不同網絡拓撲的VPC，包括公有子網和私有子網。我們將創建堡壘機，帶Web服務器的應用程序負載均衡器，私有子網內的後端機器，RDS服務器以及S3存儲桶。

Looks complicated, but it is designed to be a very wide usage sample for most general scenario.

看起來很複雜，但它被設計成一個非常廣泛的使用樣本，適用於大多數一般情況。

For this workshop, we support 3 different region: 
* N. Viginia(us-east-1)
* N. California(us-west-1)
* Tokyo(ap-northeast-1)
* Sydney(ap-southeast-2) 
* Frankfurt(eu-central-1)
* London(eu-west-2)

We pick these region becase later we will deploy the whole stack, with correct AMI support.
------

### Step 1:
Switch Region on the AWS console, a drag down menu near right-up corner.
For example, we pick **N. Viginia(us-east-1)** for our lab practice.

### Step 2:
* Check if you already have a EC2 Key pair in your selected region. 
* If not, create one through **AWS Console > EC2 > Key Pairs > Create Key Pair**. 
* Remember to download the private key(.pem) and well saved. 
* In usual, we will move it into ~/.ssh/ sub-folder in your home directory.
* To make it secure, remeber to change the privilege with command 
``` chmod 0400 XXXXX.pem ```

* If you are windows user, and you should download putty.exe and puttygen.exe from [Here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html). And also check the document [Here](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/putty/windows/puttygen) if you don't know how to convert .pem to .ppk

### Step 3:
* Create cloudformation stack: **AWS Console > Cloudformation > Create Stack > from S3 template >
https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/workshop-data-public/cloudformation-workshop-20180731-vpc-bastion-rds.cfn.yml**
* For the stack configuration:
- Stack Name: Whatever you want to name
- Environment: dev
- Availability Zone 1: Pick 1 AZ
- Availability Zone 2: Pick a different AZ
- EC2 Key Pair: Select the Key Pair Name you setup in Step 2.
- DB User/DB Password/DB Name: Please remember what you input.
* Wait till the stack creation ready, the status will change to `CREATE_COMPLETE`

### Step 4:
* Check your VPC
* Check the CloudFormation Stack, there will be a nested stack name as "VPC"
* You can find a new VPC is created
* You will find different subnet, with different property and setting.
* You will find public subnet and private subnet.

### Step 5:
* Find your Bastion
* Check the CloudFormation Stack, there will be a nested stack name as "bastion"
* Inside your VPC created in Step 4, there is new EC2 in public subnet.
* You can try to remote into that instance.
* use SSH `ssh -i XXXX.pem ec2-user@YOUR_BASTION_IP`

### Step 6:
* Find your RDS (or Aurora)
* Check the CloudFormation Stack, there will be a nested stack name as "bastion"
* Did you remember the account and password you set in the cloudformation?
* try to login into your database with following command 
* `mysql -u DBUSER -h DBADDRESS -p `

### Step 7:
* Try to create a web server and backend server
* Create cloudformation stack: **AWS Console > Cloudformation > Create Stack > from S3 template >
https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/workshop-data-public/cloudformation-workshop-20180731-alb-ec2.cfn.yml**
* For the stack configuration:
- Stack Name: Whatever you want to name, suggest we have "EC2" within the Name
- Key Name: Pick the same name from Step 2.
- VPC: Pick the new VPC we created at Step 3. 
- SSHAllowCIDR: Follow the VPC CIDR
- Public Subnet 1: Pick one subnet with "public" in name
- Public Subnet 2: Pick another one with "public" in name
- Private Subnet: Pick one subnet with "private" in name
* Wait till the stack creation ready, the status will change to `CREATE_COMPLETE`

### Step 8:
* Check your web service stack
* You will find an Application Load Balancer, A web server and a backend server, and also a S3 bucket.
* In this practice, you can see how to create resource for our basic practice. You can try to understand how we design the network topology, how we devide AZ and subnet.
* Also, we talked about the security group. 
* By default, all the network routing rule has been pre-defined, you don't need to do anything. 
* In this empty stack, you can see what we showed in the first diagram.

## After Workshop
1. Go to Cloudformation, select your stack and delete stack.
2. Remember to delete the EC2 one, and the delete the based one.
